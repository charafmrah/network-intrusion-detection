<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Applying machine learning algorithms to a network dataset, which encompasses a broad range of intrusions that were simulated in a military network atmosphere. This created a way to acquire fresh TCP/IP dump information for a network by replicating a customary U.S. Air Force LAN. The LAN mirrored a realistic environment and was struck with multiple attacks. A connection is a sequence of TCP packets beginning and ending at a certain period, when data moves from a source IP address to a target IP address using a definite protocol. Each connection is identified as either ordinary or featuring a particular attack type. Each connection holds about 100 bytes.
For each TCP/IP connection, 41 features are obtained from the normal and attack data (3 qualitative and 38 quantitative features). The class variable consists of two categories: Normal and Anomalous.
